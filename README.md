# higgs-boson-classification

In this repository I have added my colab notebook as higgs_pca.ipynb and the training dataset as training.zip.

The test file is more than 25MB and so I could not upload it to github.

The training and testing data is available on kaggle.

If you download these zip files to your google drive and then run the ipynb file then the code should run without any errors.
